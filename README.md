# Math/Stat Honors Track Project

This is my undergraduate research project for the department of mathematics and statistics honors track. In this paper, we examine the Bayesian logistic regression model. We also introduce a method of parameter estimation called a Markov Chain, and use this to estimate distributions for each model parameter. Lastly, we discuss the application of this type of model in the statistical analysis of a medical device.
